As of 2025, Abigail’s Driving School is focusing on delivering accessible, online driver education solutions—offering DMV-approved Driver Improvement and Learner’s Permit Re-Examination courses in both English and Spanish. These services are available entirely online and are designed to support individuals who have failed the Virginia DMV knowledge test or who are required to complete driver improvement for licensing or court compliance.

In addition, our affiliate platform, [Driver Training 4 Virginia](https://drivertraining4virginia.com/general/), offers an educational course focused on addressing reckless and aggressive driving behaviors. This transition supports our broader shift away from in-person instruction and toward flexible, digital learning experiences—enabling us to better serve the evolving needs of drivers across Virginia.
