Virginia requires students younger than 18 years of age who are home schooled or have not taken the course in high school to complete 36 - fifty-minute classroom course instruction before taking the behind the wheel class. Additionally, students under 18 years of age are required to complete 14, 50-minute periods of behind the wheel training. This includes seven sessions of driving and seven sessions of observing. Refer to [Virginia Department of Education](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/driver_education/index.shtml) for additional information and requirements.
