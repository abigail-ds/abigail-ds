title: Teen Drivers Education
---
Virginia requires students younger than 18 years of age who are home-schooled or have not taken the course in high school to complete 36 fifty-minute classroom instruction hours before participating in behind-the-wheel training. Additionally, students under 18 years of age are required to complete 14 fifty-minute periods of behind-the-wheel training, including seven sessions of driving and seven sessions of observing. For further details on requirements, please refer to the [Virginia Department of Education](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/).

**Service Update:**
After much consideration, we have made the decision to discontinue offering driverâ€™s education services. We encourage you to explore DMV-licensed online driver training programs to find a school that meets your needs. See list of [DMV-licensed online driver training](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/improvement/clinics-schools?f%5B0%5D=course_types%3A166&f%5B1%5D=school_type%3A326) schools to find one near you.

Thank you for your understanding.
