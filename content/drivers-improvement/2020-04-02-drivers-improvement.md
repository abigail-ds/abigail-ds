#### Program:

Our driver improvement course uses the [National Traffic Safety Institute](https://ntsi.com/about-ntsi/) (NTSI) Defensive Driving Program. NTSI is one of the first defensive driving programs established in 1974. Abigail's Driving School follows NTSI's belief that values + attitude = behavior. It is through personal responsibility that has the potential to modify driving behaviors.

#### Reasons for why you would take this class:

**Voluntarily:** If the course is taken voluntarily, you will receive up to five safe driving points towards your driving record.

**Court:** If the court assigns you to take this course you will not receive any safe driving points unless you have a court document stating otherwise. However, it will help you with a ticket.

**DMV:** If instructed by the DMV to take the class, you will receive driving points depending on your current record. Verify with Virginia DMV.

**Under 21:** For those under the age of 21, you must take the driver improvement class after each infraction until you are over 21.

**Cost:** The class is $100. Classes are held on Saturday mornings (Spanish) and Sundays (English). See [schedule and registration. ](https://booking.setmore.com/scheduleappointment/2c7d92a2-3463-4a40-8c6f-342980b8a0bf/class/cadc3aab06f7bdac6b235f9206c1eb64a9e8e59970)

**Length of class for drivers aged 55 years and older:** Per Virginia Administrative Code 24VAC20-40-30 (B) the eight hours of class time can be divided over at least a two-day period for individuals 55 years and older. This will guarantee flexibility for your schedule and allow you to get time to digest and understand all the safety information learned.
