**\*\*\*\*NEW AND VERY CONVENIENT:** Please register for the [ONLINE Driver Improvement Clinic](https://checkout.square.site/merchant/85BWEQRS81PYA/checkout/TKBYHZJIH7WZFMRGWOZ3RNGP) -  Click and follow instructions.

#### In Person Driver Improvement - We apologize we do not provide driver improvement inside the class anymore. You can only take it online with our school or you can visit the [DMV's website](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/#/) to get a list.

#### Reasons for why you would take this class:

**Voluntarily:** If the course is taken voluntarily, you will receive up to five safe driving points towards your driving record.

**Court:** If the court assigns you to take this course you will not receive any safe driving points unless you have a court document stating otherwise. However, it will help you with a ticket.

**DMV:** If instructed by the DMV to take the class, you will receive driving points depending on your current record. Verify with Virginia DMV.

**Under 21:** For those under the age of 21, you must take the driver improvement class after each infraction until you are over 21.

**Length of class for drivers aged 55 years and older:** Per Virginia Administrative Code 24VAC20-40-30 (B) the eight hours of class time can be divided over at least a two-day period for individuals 55 years and older. This will guarantee flexibility for your schedule and allow you to get time to digest and understand all the safety information learned.
