## Retaking the Knowledge Exam Program

If you fail the two-part knowledge exam three times, you must complete a Driver’s Manual/Re-examination Class at a Virginia approved Driver Training School program.  You must present the Certificate at the DMV to be eligible to take the test again. The course completion date must be after the date of the third exam failure.

**Course Details:** The eight-hour course is available to all persons at least 18 years or older and to persons under 18 if they previously completed the high-school driver education program. The course will go through the Virginia Driver’s Manual, through an interactive participation and short quizzes - we will help students gain the confidence and knowledge they need to pass their test at the DMV.
